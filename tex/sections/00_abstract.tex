This note defines \emph{Axiomatic Fundamentalism Calculus} (AFC) as a discrete calculus for mechanics in the sense of the Axiomatic Fundamentalism protocol~\cite{reginald2025af}. A single axiom is declared: relationally zero distinction is a null infinite potential that presents as stochastic chaos. From this axiom follow a bip index (integer tally), ternary outcomes on finite seats, node ledgers, and Memora as path records.

On any finite plan, the construction yields a counts-first Stokes law, a ternary XOR (TXOR) node update, and a decomposition of expected currents into potential and harmonic components. A run-and-tumble scaling limit produces diffusion-type kernels as consequences of the discrete dynamics. The calculus is formulated in terms of integer counts and ternary outcomes; continuous fields and unit systems are introduced via an explicit calibration and translation layer and, when required, a mapping to General Mechanics~\cite{reginald2025gm}.

AFC is then used as a calculator on finite graphs. Examples include a two-body phase plan on a ring, hydrogen-like radial shells, a galactic rotation test, and an incompressible Navier--Stokes update. Each example is implemented by the same local $n$-body update and the counts-first Stokes identity.
